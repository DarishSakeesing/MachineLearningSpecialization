# Machine Learning Specialization Track
This repository holds all the projects I created and submitted to the IBM Machine Learning Specialization Track offered on Coursera. The track constitutes of multiple courses.

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
In the first course of the track, I am introduced to the Machine Learning. I learnt the following:
- Retrieve data from multiple data sources: SQL, NoSQL databases, APIs, Cloud 
- Describe and use common feature selection and feature engineering techniques
- Handle categorical and ordinal features, as well as missing values
- Use a variety of techniques for detecting and dealing with outliers
- Articulate why feature scaling is important and use a variety of scaling techniques


2. Supervised Learning: Linear Regression
